These 7 rules for composition and framing will help you craft shots that look more and more professional.\n\nIn this video we explore a few of the more basic and foundational  rules of composition.  These include the rule of thirds, symmetry, leading lines, leading room, depth, and size of subject.  Lastly we look at how following these rules can help you, but strategically breaking them can also be an important decision that can benefit your project.  Ultimately, the most important part of film-making is your story.  Everything else comes second.\nSHOW LESS"
