I will instruct you through lots of different moves working all sections of your abs. We will stay in a seated position the entire time, but beware, it's not as easy as it looks!\nMake sure you have a sturdy chair for this workout. Preferably without side arms so you have a full range of movement. Please don't use your couch for chair core workout.\nI will instruct you to engage your core and pull your belly button in towards your spine repeatedly. This is to make sure we are activating the correct abdominal muscles and to protect the lower back as well.\nPlease go at your own pace and take breaks when you need to. Some of these moves are challenging. Make sure to breathe!\nCore strength is so important for overall health and well being. It affects balance, posture, spine and back health and mobility. \nGreat job in taking care your health and fitness and thanks for working out with me!\nProducts and I use and recommend can be found here:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/seniorsha...\nas an Amazon associate/influencer I earn from qualifying purchases \n\nSeniorShape is on Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SeniorShapef...\nSHOW LESS"
