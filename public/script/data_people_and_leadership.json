Empowerment refers to power sharing, the delegation of power or authority to subordinates in the organization.\n\nEmpowerment can enhance motivation by meeting the higher-level needs of employees. In addition, leaders greatly benefit from the expanded capabilities that employee participation brings to the organization.To empower followers, leaders provide them with an understanding of how their jobs are important to the organization’s mission and performance, thereby giving them a direction within which to act freely.\n\nFive elements must be in place before employees can be truly empowered to perform their jobs effectively: information, knowledge, discretion, meaning, and rewards. When employees are fully empowered, they are involved in defining mission and goals as well as in determining how to achieve them.\nSHOW LESS"
